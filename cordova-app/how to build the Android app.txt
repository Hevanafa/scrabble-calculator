I made this note just in case I forgot how to build the app.

Run this:
cordova create cordova-app com.hevanafa.scrabble_calculator scrabbleCalculatorApp

Adhere to this format:
cordova create [folder_name] [package_name] [app_name]

Then add Android platform:
cordova platform add android

Don't forget to obtain the `www` folder using the guide.

Finally when there's the `www` folder, run:
cordova build android
